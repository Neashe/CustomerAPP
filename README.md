# CustomerAPP
Short programm for reqruitment process
Programm doesn't require any command arguments.

Compiling programm:
(in src directory) javac Application.java

Running programm:
java Application


This is very simple console programm that adds and deletes customers. 
It's quite chaotic, but should implement all functional features.

Features that would be added next:
1. possibility to updating customer by user
2. Saving data to json file (jackson library)
3. Adding simple UI
